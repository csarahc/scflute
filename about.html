		<p>
			Hello! My name is Sarah. I am a student at university studying
			computer science and playing the flute is one of my hobbies. I
			started playing the flute since the age of 9 when I joined band in
			middle school. From then on, I developed a strong passion for the
			flute and continued to play in band all the way through high school.
			I am a self-taught flutist; I never had any teachers or private
			lessons before. I first started recording flute videos and posting
			them in 9th grade. I love musicals, classic, pop, and many more
			genres of music! I was also a first chair flute in Wind Ensemble
			during my junior year in high school. I enjoy playing and recording
			flute during my spare time in college and posting videos on my
			YouTube channel! :D
